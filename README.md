# Image-Processing

Here are some simple algorithms for image processing in C without use of any external libraries.

These algorithms are applied to bitmap (.bmp) files, because the bitmap format is probably the easiest to read. 

Most of the functions (all except those with 'rgb' in their names)
work for grayscale images only but can easily be transformed for work with color images.
